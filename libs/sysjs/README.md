# mach/sysjs - enables Zig/WASM to speak to JavaScript

This repository is a separate copy of the same library in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach), and is automatically kept in sync, so that anyone can use this library in their own project if they like!

## Experimental

This is an _experimental_ Mach library, according to our [stability guarantees](https://machengine.org/next/docs/libs/):

> Experimental libraries may have their APIs change without much notice, and you may have to look at recent changes in order to update your code.

[Why this library is not declared stable yet](https://machengine.org/next/docs/libs/experimental/#sysjs)

## Issues

Issues are tracked in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asysjs).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Pull requests must be sent to [the main repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/tree/main/libs/sysjs) to avoid some complex merge conflicts we'd get by accepting contributions in both repositories. Once the changes are merged there, they'll get sync'd to this repository automatically.
